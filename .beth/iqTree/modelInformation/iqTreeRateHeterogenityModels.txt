+I=allowing for a proportion of invariable sites.
+G=discrete Gamma model (Yang, 1994) with default 4 rate categories. The number of categories can be changed with e.g. +G8.
+I+G=invariable site plus discrete Gamma model (Gu et al., 1995).
+R=FreeRate model (Yang, 1995; Soubrier et al., 2012) that generalizes the +G model by relaxing the assumption of Gamma-distributed rates. The number of categories can be specified with e.g. +R6 (default 4 categories if not specified). The FreeRate model typically fits data better than the +G model and is recommended for analysis of large data sets.
+I+R=invariable site plus FreeRate model.
